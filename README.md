# Portfolio Web - Front-End Developer

This is my portfolio as a Web Developer, you will find the different projects that I have developed in the last year, since a decided to start study by myself and turn my life around quiting to my job as a civil engineer in Colombia and move to Brazil looking for love in different ways.

The disign was a hard challenge and I decided to keep it simple. If you have any advice don't hesitate and get in touch.
